# Mini

Currently an experiment with JS application architecture.

Mostly inspired by Redux, Reflux and Cycle.js + RxJs.

Places all action handling in one spot through one global reducer and a function
per action to update state (which is an alternate way of structuring redux too)


Simple, minimal, light

State is a stream

View framework agnostic
